            This interactive visualization offers an engaging exploration of national parks across the United States.
            Through an intuitive map interface, users can visualize the distribution of parks by state, with varying shades of green indicating the density of parks in each state.
            As users interact with individual park markers, they can access detailed information and images, providing insights into each park's unique features.</p>
            
            <p><span><b>Dataset: </b></span>The dataset used is Biodiversity in National Parks.</p>
            <span><b>Marks:</b></span>
            <ul>
                <li>Area of polygons represent US States</li>
                <li>National Parks are marked using a logo(Circle overlayed with a Forest icon).</li>
                <li>Area marks in Pie Chart represent highlevel categories of species in a national park i.e., Animals, Invertebrates, Plants, Algae_Fungi.</li>
                <li>Area marks in Circular Bar chart represent species category as defined in the dataset.</li>
            </ul>
            <span><b>Channels:</b></span>
            <ul>
                <li>Green Color Saturation on the United States Map represent number of National Parks in a State.</li>
                <li>The size and color saturation of the logo used to mark National Parks represent the Park Acres.</li>
                <li>The Color hue, arc-size, angle of pies in pie chart are channels representing the number of species in a highlevel category.</li>
                <li>The radius of the Bars from center and their color are channels in Circular Bar plot represent the number of species in a category.</li>
            </ul>
            <span><b>Interactions:</b></span>
            <ul>
                <li>Mouse Hover: When a mouse is hovered over the marker at the National Park location, an image of National Park is shown as tooltip.</li>
                <li>Mouse Click: When a mouse is clicked over the marker at the National Park location, a modal opens up which shows a custom visualization.</li>
            </ul>
            <span><b>Custom Visualization:</b></span>
            <p>The visualization falls under the <span><b><i>Combinatorial Custom Visualization.</i></b></span></p>
            <p>The visualization combines several visualization techniques and interaction methods to present the information about US national parks in an engaging and effective manner.
               It begins with a Chloropeth map of United States, when clicked on it, the two main components pie chart and circular bar plot are visualized within the modal.
               By combining these two chart types, the visualization offers multi-layered exploration of the data i.e., Highlevel categories and distribution of specific categories in a national park.
