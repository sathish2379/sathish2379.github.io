                    <h2> Software Engineer II</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engineered two long-term solutions in Java that streamlined the identification and organization of 40+ configuration properties per application across 15+ acquirer applications. This reduced manual intervention by 70% and ensured consistency in configuration values. Consequently, new Java property files replaced the old legacy system.
                        </li>
                        <li>Additionally, successfully diagnosed and resolved bugs in infrastructure libraries, improving support for new configurations. During the deployment of acquirer subsystem on new VMs, collaborated with subject matter experts to troubleshoot and resolve issues, achieving a seamless deployment with a 100% success rate. Prepared a Solution Proposal in collaboration with the Product Owner, introducing two new Privileges at four stages, enabling merchants to charge fees and facilitate split order functionality at the payment gateway.
                        </li>
                        <li>Furthermore, I led an in-depth system analysis of existing acquiring applications, eliminating hard dependencies by developing new libraries for various capabilities such as log sanitization and context management. I also implemented custom metrics to monitor application performance.
                        </li>
                        <li>Developed Spring Boot acquirer applications with secure REST calls, transaction routing, and message translation into ISO8583 format using Java 17. Achieved service-to-service communication security by integrating a JSON Web Token (JWT) based security framework for request authorization. For testing purposes, created in-built simulators and customized the Mastercard flow testing framework to support secure REST calls, enabling seamless regression testing of three applications through a Jenkins pipeline. To enhance application resiliency, implemented circuit breakers by leveraging Spring Circuit Breaker Resilience4j and successfully deployed applications on PCF cloud by integrating a CI/CD pipeline using BTE scripts.
